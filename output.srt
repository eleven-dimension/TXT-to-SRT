1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive,

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:20,000
were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much.

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:30,000
They were the last people you'd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious,

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:40,000
because they just didn't hold with such nonsense.

5
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made drills.

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:01:00,000
He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a very large mustache.

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck,

8
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:20,000
which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbors.

9
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere.

10
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:40,000
The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it.

11
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:50,000
They didn't think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters.

12
00:01:50,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Mrs. Potter was Mrs. Dursley's sister, but they hadn't met for several years;

13
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:10,000
in fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended she didn't have a sister,

14
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:20,000
because her sister and her good-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be.

15
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:30,000
The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street.

16
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:40,000
The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but they had never even seen him.

17
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:50,000
This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away;

18
00:02:50,000 --> 00:03:00,000
they didn't want Dudley mixing with a child like that.When Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull,

19
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:10,000
gray Tuesday our story starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country.

20
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work,

21
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:30,000
and Mrs. Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair.

22
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:40,000
None of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past the window.

23
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:50,000
At half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked Mrs. Dursley on the cheek,

24
00:03:50,000 --> 00:04:00,000
and tried to kiss Dudley good-bye but missed,

25
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:10,000
because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls.
